# 4.FizzBuzz
## Project Description
FizzBuzz is a word game and coding challenge that involves counting numbers and replacing certain numbers with words: 

Word game
Players take turns counting numbers, replacing numbers divisible by three with "fizz", numbers divisible by five with "buzz", and numbers divisible by both three and five with "fizzbuzz". It's a children's game that teaches division. 

Coding challenge
A common programming task in technical interviews and take-home assignments. The challenge is to write a solution that prints numbers from 1 to N, replacing numbers divisible by three with "fizz", numbers divisible by five with "buzz", and numbers divisible by both three and five with "fizzbuzz". 
The coding challenge is used to assess a candidate's understanding of basic tools like if-else statements and loops. It can also be used to help weed out weaker applicants. 
Here are some tips for approaching the FizzBuzz challenge: 
There are multiple ways to solve the challenge, and some solutions may be more impressive than others. 
Consider using a warm-up with minimal functional requirements that increase in size as the exercise progresses. 
Use stretch goals so that the interviewer can adapt the challenge based on the candidate's progress. 
End the challenge by asking the candidate to commit their changes to a new branch in git. This allows the interviewer to assess the candidate's git comfort level and compare candidate attempts.
